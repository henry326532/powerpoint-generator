## 1. Use ChatGPT to generate powerpoint outline

Letâ€™s consider a scenario: You were asked to explain to a software team and convince them to switch from Java to Python. You know that Python is powerful, especially powered by its ecosystem, community support, and online software repository. But building a story pitch needs some thought.

You can make use of ChatGPT to create the story pitch. Your prompt should include:

Persona: ChatGPT should sound like an expert
Goal: You want an outline that you can use to build a slide deck
Details: Your storyline should be that Python can work better than Java. Depending on the use case, you may want to give more detail on a particular application, such as REST API system
Therefore, you may try the following prompt:

You are an expert in Python programming and system development.

Write the outline for a slide deck to pitch the Python ecosystem to a Java veteran. Tell them how Python can do all the things that they were doing with Java. Focus on the benefits of easy to use, easy to develop, and easy to maintain. Especially focusing on how Python supports building a scalable system with REST API support.
